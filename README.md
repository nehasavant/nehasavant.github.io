# Welcome to Neha's first Jekyll website!

### Neha Savant is a second-year MA student studying Ecology, Evolution & Conservation Biology. She's interested in landscape genetics and translating inferences from scientific studies to conservation action. She's got a particular affinity for amphibians, one of which she's focusing on for her MA thesis:

The study focuses on understanding the genetic connectivity and population structure of this threatened salamander across its pond and stream habitats. This is a particularly urgent study as there is a [pipeline] proposed to be built across the salamanders' stream habitats.  We are using information gleaned from this study to understand how the pipeline may affect the connectivity and long-term survival of the populations on and near pipeline crossings.
